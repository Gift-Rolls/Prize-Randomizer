# ðŸŽ¡ Rolls Trading Competition
Welcome to the Rolls Trading Competition prize selection! For more details about the competition, prizes, and rules, please check our [telegram post](https://t.me/rolls_tv/1921).

## Random Seed
The random seed used for selecting the winners will be determined during a livestream on [@rolls_tv](https://t.me/rolls_tv) channel. We will roll 5 dice emojis ðŸŽ² to generate a 5-digit number, which will be used as random seed. This ensures complete transparency and fairness in the winner selection process, because Telegram garantees the randomness of the dice.

Note: identificator of the user is Telegram ID, not username.

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
